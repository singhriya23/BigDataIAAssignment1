ABSTRACT
In order to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on higher education, we surveyed 
approximately 1,500 students at one of the largest public institutions in the United States using an 
instrument designed to recover the causal impact of the pandemic on students' current and 
expected outcomes. Results show large negative effects across many dimensions. Due to 
COVID-19: 13% of students have delayed graduation, 40% lost a job, internship, or a job offer, 
and 29% expect to earn less at age 35. Moreover, these effects have been highly heterogeneous. 
One quarter of students increased their study time by more than 4 hours per week due to 
COVID-19, while another quarter decreased their study time by more than 5 hours per week. This 
heterogeneity often followed existing socioeconomic divides; lower-income students are 55% 
more likely to have delayed graduation due to COVID-19 than their higher-income peers. Finally, 
we show that the economic and health related shocks induced by COVID-19 vary systematically 
by socioeconomic factors and constitute key mediators in explaining the large (and 
heterogeneous) effects of the pandemic.

Introduction
The disruptive eﬀects of the COVID-19 outbreak have impacted almost all sectors of our society. Higher
education is no exception. Anecdotal evidence paints a bleak picture for both students and universities.
According to the American Council on Education, enrollment is likely to drop by 15% in the fall of 2020,
while at the same time many institutions may have to confront demands for large tuition cuts if classes
remain virtual.1 In a similar vein, students face an increasingly uncertain environment, where ﬁnancial and
health shocks (for example, lack of resources to complete their studies or fear of becoming seriously sick),
along with the transition to online learning may have aﬀected their academic performance, educational plans,
current labor market participation, and expectations about future employment.
This paper attempts to shed light on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students. First,
we describe and quantify the causal eﬀects of the COVID-19 outbreak on a wide set of students’ out-
comes/expectations. In particular, we analyze enrollment and graduation decisions, academic performance,
major choice, study and social habits, remote learning experiences, current labor market participation,
and expectations about future employment. Second, we study how these eﬀects diﬀer along existing so-
cioeconomic divides, and whether the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities. Finally, we present
suggestive evidence on the mechanisms behind the heterogeneous COVID-19 eﬀects by quantifying the role
of individual-level ﬁnancial and health shocks on academic decisions and labor market expectations.
For this purpose, we surveyed about 1,500 undergraduate students at Arizona State University (ASU),
one of the largest public universities in the United States, in late April 2020. The fact that ASU is a large
and highly diverse institution makes our ﬁndings relevant for most public institutions in the country. The
survey was explicitly designed to not only collect student outcomes and expectations after the onset of the
pandemic, but also to recover counterfactual outcomes in the absence of the outbreak. Speciﬁcally, the survey
asked students about their current experiences/expectations and what those experiences/expectations would
have been had it not been for the pandemic. Because we collect information conditional on both states of
the world (with the COVID-19 pandemic, and without) from each student, we can directly analyze how
each student believes COVID-19 has impacted their current and future outcomes.2 For example, by asking
students about their current GPA in a post-COVID-19 world and their expected GPA in the absence of
COVID-19, we can back out the subjective treatment eﬀect of COVID-19 on academic performance. The
credibility of our approach depends on: (1) students having well-formed beliefs about outcomes in the
counterfactual scenario. This is a plausible assumption in our context since the counterfactual state is a
1See, the New York Times article “After Coronavirus, Colleges Worry: Will Students Come Back?” (April 15, 2020) for a
discussion surrounding students’ demands for tuition cuts.
2In some cases, instead of asking students for the outcomes in both states of the world, we directly ask for the diﬀerence.
For example, the survey asked how the pandemic had aﬀected the student’s graduation date.

realistic and relevant one - it was the status quo less than two months before the survey, and (2) there being
no systematic bias in the reporting of the data - an assumption that is implicitly made when using any
survey data.3
Our ﬁndings on academic outcomes indicate that COVID-19 has led to a large number of students delaying
graduation (13%), withdrawing from classes (11%), and intending to change majors (12%).
Moreover,
approximately 50% of our sample separately reported a decrease in study hours and in their academic
performance. The data also show that while all subgroups of the population have experienced negative
eﬀects due to the outbreak, the size of the eﬀects is heterogeneous. For example, compared to their higher-
income counterparts, lower-income students (those with below-median parental income) are substantially
more likely to delay graduation. Finally, we ﬁnd that students report a decrease in their likelihood of taking
online classes as a result of their recent experiences. These eﬀects are, however, more than 150% larger for
honors students, suggesting that, a priori, most engaged students strongly prefer in-person classes.
As expected, the COVID-19 outbreak also had large negative eﬀects on students’ current labor market
participation and expectations about post-college labor outcomes. Working students suﬀered a 31% decrease
in their wages and a 37% drop in weekly hours worked, on average. Moreover, around 40% of students lost
a job, internship, or a job oﬀer, and 61% reported to have a family member that experienced a reduction
in income. The pandemic also had a substantial impact on students’ expectations about their labor market
prospects post-college. For example, their perceived probability of ﬁnding a job decreased by almost 20%,
and their expected earnings when 35 years old (around 15 years from the outbreak) declined by approximately
2.5%. This last ﬁnding suggests that students expect the pandemic to have a long-lasting impact on their
labor market prospects.
We ﬁnd that the substantial variation in the impact of COVID-19 on students tracked with existing
socioeconomic divides. For example, compared to their more aﬄuent peers, lower-income students are 55%
more likely to delay graduation due to COVID-19 and are 41% more likely to report that COVID-19 impacted
their major choice. Further, COVID-19 nearly doubled the gap between higher- and lower-income students’
expected GPA.4 There also is substantial variation in the pandemic’s eﬀect on preference for online learning,
with Honors students and males revising their preferences down by more than 2.5 times as much as their
peers. However, despite appearing to be more disrupted by the switch to online learning, the impact of
COVID-19 on Honors students’ academic outcomes is consistently smaller than the impact on non-Honors
students.
3This approach has been used successfully in several other settings, such as to construct career and family returns to
college majors (Arcidiacono et al., 2020; Wiswall and Zafar, 2018), and the causal impact of health on retirement (Shapiro and
Giustinelli, 2019)
4The income gap in GPA increased from 0.052 to 0.098 on a 4 point scale. It is signiﬁcant at the 1% level in both scenarios.

Finally, we evaluate the extent to which mitigating factors associated with more direct economic and
health shocks from the pandemic (for example, a family member losing income due to COVID-19, or the
expected probability of hospitalization if contracting COVID-19) can explain much of the heterogeneity
in pandemic eﬀects. We ﬁnd that both types of shock (economic and health) play an important role in
determining students’ COVID-19 experiences. For example, the expected probability of delaying graduation
due to COVID-19 increases by approximately 25% if either a student’s subjective probability of being late on
a debt payment in the following 90 days (a measure of ﬁnancial fragility) or subjective probability of requiring
hospitalization conditional on contracting COVID-19 increases by one standard deviation. As expected, the
magnitude of health and economic shocks are not homogeneous across the student population. The average
of the principal component for the economic and health shocks is about 0.3-0.4 standard deviations higher for
students from lower-income families. Importantly, we ﬁnd that the disparate economic and health impacts
of COVID-19 can explain 40% of the delayed graduation gap (as well as a substantial part of the gap for
other outcomes) between lower- and higher-income students.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst paper to shed light on the eﬀects of COVID-19 on college students’
experiences. The treatment eﬀects that we ﬁnd are large in economic terms. Whether students are overre-
acting in their response to the COVID-19 shock is not clear. Individuals generally tend to overweight recent
experiences (Malmendier and Nagel, 2016; Kuchler and Zafar, 2019). However, whether students’ subjective
treatment eﬀects are “correct” in some ex-post sense is beside the point. As long as students are reporting
their subjective beliefs without any systematic bias, it is the perceived treatment eﬀects, not actual ones, –
regardless of whether they are correct or not – which are fundamental to understanding choices. For example,
if students (rightly or wrongly) perceive a negative treatment eﬀect of COVID-19 on the returns to a college
degree, this belief will have an impact on their future human capital decisions (such as continuing with their
education, choice of major, etc.).
Our results underscore the fact that the COVID-19 shock is likely to exacerbate socioeconomic disparities
in higher education. This is consistent with ﬁndings regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on K-12 students.
Kuhfeld et al., 2020 project that school closures are likely to lead to signiﬁcant learning losses in math
and reading. However, they estimate heterogeneous eﬀects, and conclude that high-performing students are
likely to make gains. Likewise, Chetty et al., 2020 ﬁnd that, post-COVID, student progress on an online
math program decreased signiﬁcantly more in poorer ZIP codes. Our analysis reveals that the heterogeneous
economic and health burden imposed by COVID-19 is partially responsible for these varying impacts. This
suggests that by addressing the economic and health impacts imposed by COVID-19, policy makers may be
able to prevent COVID-19 from widening existing gaps in higher education.

Data
2.1
Survey
Our data come from an original survey of undergraduate students at Arizona State University (ASU),
one of the largest public universities in the United States. Like other higher educational institutions in the
US, the Spring 2020 semester started in person. However, in early March during spring break, the school
announced that instruction would be transitioned online and that students were advised not to return to
campus.
The study was advertised on the My ASU website, accessible only through the student’s ASU ID and
password. Undergraduate students were invited to participate in an online survey about their experiences
and expectations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, for which they would be paid $10. The study was
posted during the second to last week of instruction for the spring semester (April 23rd). Our sample size
was constrained by the research funds to 1,500 students, and the survey was closed once the desired sample
size was reached. We reached the desired sample size within 3 days of posting the survey.
The survey was programmed in Qualtrics. It collected data on students’ demographics and family back-
ground, their current experiences (both for academic outcomes and non-academic outcomes), and their
future expectations. Importantly, for the purposes of this study, the survey collected data on what these
outcomes/expectations would have been in the counterfactual state, without COVID-19.
2.2
Sample
A total of 1,564 respondents completed the survey.5 90 respondents were ineligible for the study (such
as students enrolled in graduate degree programs or diploma programs) and were dropped from the sample.
Finally, responses in the 1st and 99th percentile of survey duration were further excluded, leading to a ﬁnal
sample size of 1,446. The survey took 38 minutes to complete, on average (median completion time was 26
minutes).
The ﬁrst ﬁve columns of Table 1 show how our sample compares with the broader ASU undergradu-
ate population and the average undergraduate student at other large ﬂagship universities (speciﬁcally, the
largest public universities in each state). Relative to the ASU undergraduate population, our sample has a
signiﬁcantly higher proportion of ﬁrst-generation students (that is, students with no parent with a college
degree) and a smaller proportion of international students. The demographic composition of our sample
compares reasonably well with that of students in ﬂagship universities. Our sample is also positively selected
in terms of SAT/ACT scores relative to these two populations.
5The 64 people taking the survey at the moment the target sample size (1,500) was reached were allowed to ﬁnish.

The better performance on admission tests could be explained by the high proportion of Honors students
in our sample (22% compared to 18% in the ASU population). The last four columns of Table 1 show how
Honors students compare with ASU students and the average college student at a top-10 university. We see
that they perform better than the average ASU student (which is expected) and just slightly worse than the
average college student at a top-10 university. The share of white Honors students in our sample (60%) is
higher than the proportion in the ASU population and much higher than the proportion of white students
in the top-10 universities.
Overall, we believe our sample of ASU students is a reasonable representation of students at other large
public schools, while the Honors students may provide insight into the experiences of students at more elite
institutions.

Analytic Framework
We next outline a simple analytic framework that guides the empirical analysis . Let Oi(COV ID-19) be
the potential outcome of individual i associated with COVID-19 treatment. We are interested in the causal
impact of COVID-19 on student outcomes:
∆i(O) = Oi(COV ID-19 = 1) −Oi(COV ID-19 = 0),
(1)
where the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is student i’s outcome in the state of the world with COVID-19,
and the second term being student i’s outcome in the state of the world without COVID-19. Recovering
the treatment eﬀect at the individual level entails comparison of the individual’s outcomes in two alternate
states of the world. With standard data on realizations, a given individual is observed in only one state of the
world (in our case, COV ID-19 = 1). The alternate outcomes are counterfactual and unobserved. A large
econometric and statistics literature studies how to identify these counterfactual outcomes and moments of
the counterfactual outcomes (such as average treatment eﬀects) from realized choice data (e.g., Heckman
and Vytlacil, 2005; Angrist and Pischke, 2009; Imbens and Rubin, 2015). Instead, the approach we use in
this paper is to directly ask individuals for their expected outcomes in both states of the world. From the
collected data, we can then directly calculate the individual-level subjective treatment eﬀect. As an example,
consider beliefs about end-of-semester GPA. The survey asked students “What semester-level GPA do you
expect to get at the end of this semester?” This is ﬁrst-term on the right-hand side of equation (1). The
counterfactual is elicited as follows
“Were it not for the COVID-19 pandemic, what semester-level GPA
would you have expected to get at the end of the semester?”. The diﬀerence in the responses to these two
6


## Page 8

questions gives us the subjective expected treatment eﬀect of COVID-19 on the student’s GPA. For certain
binary outcomes in the survey, we directly ask students for the ∆i. For example, regarding graduation plans,
we simply ask a student if the ∆i is positive, negative, or zero: “How has the COVID-19 pandemic aﬀected
your graduation plan? [graduate later; graduation plan unaﬀected; graduate earlier].”
The approach we use in this paper follows a small and growing literature that uses subjective expectations
to understand decision-making under uncertainty. Speciﬁcally, Arcidiacono et al. (2020) and Wiswall and
Zafar (2018) ask college students about their beliefs for several outcomes associated with counterfactual
choices of college majors, and estimate the ex-ante treatment eﬀects of college majors on career and family
outcomes. Shapiro and Giustinelli (2019) use a similar approach to estimate the subjective ex-ante treatment
eﬀects of health on labor supply. There is one minor distinction from these papers: while these papers
elicit ex-ante treatment eﬀects, in our case, we look at outcomes that have been observed (for example,
withdrawing from a course during the semester) as well as those that will be observed in the future (such
as age 35 earnings). Thus, some of our subjective treatment eﬀects are ex-post in nature while others are
ex-ante.
The soundness of our approach depends on a key assumption that students have well-formed expectations
for outcomes in both the realized state and the counterfactual state. Since the outcomes we ask about are
absolutely relevant and germane to students, they should have well-formed expectations for the realized state.
In addition, given that the counterfactual state is the one that had been the status quo in prior semesters
(and so students have had prior experiences in that state of the world), their ability to have expectations for
outcomes in the counterfactual state should not be a controversial assumption.6

Empirical Analysis
4.1
Treatment Eﬀects
We start with the analysis of the aggregate-level treatment eﬀects, which are presented in Table 2. The
outcomes are organized in two groups, academic and labor market (see Appendix Table A1 for a complete
list of outcomes). The ﬁrst two columns of the table show the average beliefs for those outcomes where the
survey elicited beliefs in both states of the world. The average treatment eﬀects shown in column (3) are of
particular interest. Since we can compute the individual-level treatment eﬀects, columns (4)-(7) of the table
show the cross-sectional heterogeneity in the treatment eﬀects.
6This is diﬀerent from asking students in normal times about their expected outcomes in a state with online teaching and no
campus activities (COVID-19) since most students would not have had any experience with this counterfactual prior to March
this year.
7


## Page 9

We see that the average treatment eﬀects are statistically and economically signiﬁcant for all outcomes.
The average impacts on academic outcomes, shown in Panel A, are mostly negative. For example, the average
subjective treatment eﬀect of COVID-19 on semester-level GPA is a decline of 0.17 points. More than 50%
of the students in our sample expect a decrease in their GPA due to the treatment (versus only 7% expecting
an increase). Additionally, on average, 13% of the participants delayed their graduation, 11% withdrew from
a class during the spring semester, and 12% stated that their major choice was impacted by COVID-19. An
interesting and perhaps unanticipated result is that, on average, students are 4 percentage points less likely
to enroll in an online class given their experience with online instruction due to the pandemic.7,8 However,
there is a substantial amount of variation in terms of the direction of the eﬀect: 31% (47%) of the participants
are now more (less) likely to enroll in online classes. We explore this heterogeneity in more detail in the
next section, but it seems that prior experience with having taken online classes somewhat ameliorates the
negative experience: the average treatment eﬀect for students with prior experience with online classes is a
2.4 percentage points decrease in their likelihood of enrolling in online classes, versus a 9.5 percentage points
decline for their counterparts (diﬀerence statistically signiﬁcant at the 0.1% level).
This large variation in the treatment eﬀects of COVID-19 is apparent in several of the other outcomes,
such as study hours, where the average treatment eﬀect of COVID-19 on weekly study hours is -0.9 (that is,
students spend 0.9 less hours studying per week due to COVID-19). The interquartile range of the across-
subject treatment eﬀect demonstrates substantial variation, with the pandemic decreasing study time by 5
hours at the 25th percentile and increasing study time by 4 hours at the 75th.
Overall, these results suggest that COVID-19 represents a substantial disruption to students’ academic
experiences, and is likely to have lasting impacts through changes in major/career and delayed gradua-
tion timelines. Students’ negative experiences with online teaching, perhaps due to the abruptness of the
transition, also has implications for the willingness of students to take online classes in the future.
Turning to Panel B in Table 2, we see that students’ current and expected labor market outcomes were
substantially disrupted by COVID-19. As for the extensive margin of current employment, on average, 29%
of the students lost the jobs they were working at prior to the pandemic (67% of the students were working
prior to the pandemic), 13% of students had their internships or job oﬀers rescinded, and 61% of the students
reported that a close family member had lost their job or experienced an income reduction. The last statistic
is in line with ﬁndings from other surveys of widespread economic disruption across the US.9 Respondents
7The questions that were asked to elicit this were: “ Suppose you are given the choice to take a course online/remote or
in-person. [Had you NOT had experience with online/remote classes this semester], what is the percent chance that you would
opt for the online/remote option?”
8This result is in line with a survey about eLearning experiences across diﬀerent universities in Washington and New York
that concludes that 75% of the students are unhappy with the quality of their classes after moving to online learning due to
COVID-19.
9According to the US Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey Week 3, 48% of the surveyed households have experienced a
8


## Page 10

experienced an average decrease of 11.5 hours of work per week and a 21% decrease in weekly earnings,
although there was no change in weekly earnings for 52% of the sample, which again reﬂects substantial
variation in the eﬀects of COVID-19 across students.
In terms of labor market expectations, on average, students foresee a 13 percentage points decrease in
the probability of ﬁnding a job by graduation, a reduction of 2 percent in their reservation wages, and a
2.3 percent decrease in their expected earnings at age 35. The signiﬁcant changes in reservation wages and
expected earnings at age 35 due to COVID-19 demonstrate that students expect the treatment eﬀects of
COVID-19 to be long-lasting. This is consistent with Oreopoulos et al. (2012) which ﬁnds that graduating
during a recession implies an initial loss in earnings of 9% that decreases to 4.5% within 5 years and disappears
after 10 years. Rothstein (2020) estimates that the Great Recession may have even longer-lasting eﬀects on
graduates’ employment.
4.2
Heterogeneous Eﬀects
We next explore demographic heterogeneity in the treatment eﬀects of COVID-19. Figure 1 plots the
average treatment eﬀects across several relevant demographic divisions including gender, race, parental
education, and parental income. Honors college status and expected graduation cohort are also included as
interesting dimensions of heterogeneity in the COVID-19 context. The ﬁgure shows the impacts for six of
the more economically meaningful outcomes from Table 2 (additional outcomes can be found in Figure A1).
At least four patterns of note emerge from Figure 1. First, compared to their classmates, students from
disadvantaged backgrounds (lower-income students deﬁned as those with below-median parental income,
racial minorities, and ﬁrst-generation students) experienced larger negative impacts for the academic out-
comes, as shown in the ﬁrst three panels of the ﬁgure.10 The trends are most striking for lower-income
students, who are 55% more likely to delay graduation due to COVID-19 than their more aﬄuent class-
mates (0.16 increase in the proportion of those expecting to delay graduation versus 0.10), expect 30%
larger negative eﬀects on their semester GPA due to COVID-19, and are 41% more likely to report that
COVID-19 impacted their major choice (these diﬀerences are statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level). For
some academic outcomes, COVID-19 had similarly disproportionate eﬀects on nonwhite and ﬁrst-generation
students, with nonwhite students being 70% more likely to report changing their major choice compared
to their white peers, and ﬁrst-generation students being 50% more likely to delay their graduation than
students with college-educated parents.
Thus, while on average COVID-19 negatively impacted several
measures of academic achievement for all subgroups, the eﬀects are signiﬁcantly more pronounced for socioe-
loss in employment income since March 13 2020.
10The cutoﬀfor median parental income in our sample is $80,000

conomic groups which were predisposed towards worse academic outcomes pre-COVID.11 The pandemic’s
widening of existing achievement gaps can be seen directly in students’ expected Semester GPA. Without
COVID-19, lower-income students expected a 0.052 lower semester GPA than their higher-income peers.
With COVID-19, this gap nearly doubles to 0.098.12
Second, Panel (d) of Figure 1 shows that the switch to online learning was substantially harder for some
demographic groups; for example, men are 7 percentage points less likely to opt for an online version of a
course as a result of the COVID-19 treatment, while women do not have a statistically signiﬁcant change in
their online preferences. We also see that Honors students revise their preferences by more than 2.5 times
the amount of non-Honors students. As we show later (in Table 4), these gaps persist after controlling
for household income, major, and cohort, suggesting that the switch to online learning mid-semester may
have been substantially more disruptive for males and Honors students. While the eﬀect of COVID-19 on
preferences for online learning looks similar for males and Honors students, our survey evidence indicates
that diﬀerent mechanisms underpin these shifts.
Based on qualitative evidence, it appears that Honors
students had a negative reaction to the transition to online learning because they felt less challenged, while
males were more likely to struggle with the learning methods available through the online platform.13 One
speculative explanation for the gender diﬀerence is that consumption value of college amenities is higher for
men (however, Jacob et al. (2018), ﬁnd little gender diﬀerence in willingness to pay for the amenities they
consider).
The third trend worth highlighting from Figure 1 is that Honors students were better able to mitigate
the negative eﬀect of COVID-19 on their academic outcomes (panels a, b, and c), despite appearing to be
more disrupted by the move to online learning (panel d). Honors students report being less than half as
likely as non-Honors students to delay graduation and change their major due to COVID-19. Extrapolating
from these patterns provides suggestive evidence that academic impacts for students attending elite schools–
the group more comparable to these Honors students– are likely to have been small relative to the impacts
for the average student at large public schools.
Finally, the last two panels of Figure 1 present the COVID eﬀect on two labor market expectations and
show much less meaningful heterogeneity across demographic groups compared to the academic outcomes
in previous panels. This suggests that, while students believe COVID-19 will impact both their academic
11Based on analysis of ASU administrative data including transcripts, we ﬁnd that, relative to their counterparts, ﬁrst-
generation, lower-income, and non-white students drop out at higher rates, take longer to graduate, have lower GPAs at
graduation, and are more likely to switch majors when in college (see Appendix Table A3)
12The diﬀerence is signiﬁcant at 1% in both cases.
13Honors students were as likely as non-Honors students to say that classes got easier after they went online but, conditional on
saying classes got easier, were 47% more likely to say “homework/test questions got easier.” Conversely, males were marginally
more likely to say classes got harder after they went online (10% more likely, p=0.055) and, conditional on this, were 14% more
likely to say that “online material is not clear”.

outcomes and future labor market outcomes, they do not believe there is a strong connection between
these domains. Supporting this observation, the individual-speciﬁc treatment eﬀect on semester GPA is
only weakly correlated with the individual-speciﬁc treatment eﬀects on ﬁnding a job before graduation
(corr=0.0497, p=0.065) and expected earnings at 35 (corr=0.0467, p=0.077). The one notable exception to
the lack of heterogeneity in panels (e) and (f) of Figure 1 is the 2020 cohort, which on average revised their
subjective probability of ﬁnding a job before graduation three times as much as other cohorts. However,
students expecting to graduate in 2021 and later still believe that COVID-19 will impact their job market
outcomes; even students who plan to graduate in 2023 expect to be 6 percentage points less likely to ﬁnd a
job before graduating due to COVID-19.

Mechanisms behind the COVID-19 Eﬀects
This section presents mediation analysis on the drivers of the underlying heterogeneity in the treatment
eﬀects. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as both an economic and a health shock. However, these shocks may
have been quite heterogeneous across the various groups, and that could partly explain the heterogeneous
treatment eﬀects we documented in the previous section.
5.1
Economic and Health Mediating Factors
We proxy for the ﬁnancial and health shocks due to COVID-19 by relying on a small but relevant set
of exogenous/predetermined variables. Financial shocks are characterized based on whether a student lost
a job due to COVID-19, whether a student’s family members lost income due to COVID-19, the change in
a student’s monthly earnings due to COVID-19, and the likelihood a student will fail to fully meet debt
payments in the next 90 days. To measure health shocks, we consider a student’s belief about the likelihood
that they will be hospitalized if they contract COVID-19, a student’s belief about the likelihood that they
will have contracted COVID-19 by summer, and a student’s subjective health assessment. Finally, in order
to summarize the combined eﬀect of each set of proxies, we also construct principal component scores as
one-dimensional measures of the ﬁnancial and health shock to students.14
Table 3 reports summary statistics of the diﬀerent economic and health proxies by demographic group.
Given the results in Figure 1, the remainder of the analysis will focus on three socioeconomic divisions:
parental income, gender, and Honors college status. Our data indicate that lower-income students faced
larger health and economic shocks as compared to their more aﬄuent peers. In particular, they are almost
10 percentage points more likely to expect to default on their debt payments than their higher-income
14Eigenvalues indicate the presence of only one principal component for each of the shocks.

counterparts. Additionally, lower-income students are 16 percentage points more likely to have had a close
family member experience an income reduction due to COVID-19. Regarding the health proxies, lower-
income students rate their health as worse than higher-income students and perceive a higher probability of
being hospitalized if they catch the virus. Finally, the diﬀerences in economic and health shocks between
lower and higher-income students, as summarized by the principle components of the selected proxy variables,
are statistically signiﬁcant.
Columns (5)-(7) of Table 3 show that both economic and health shocks are larger for non-Honors students.
In fact, the average diﬀerences in the principal component scores for both the economic and health factors
is larger for these two groups than for the income groups. Finally, the last three columns of the table show
that women experienced larger COVID-19 shocks due to economic and health factors. These diﬀerences
are partly driven by the fact that, in our sample, females are more likely to report that they belong to a
lower-income household than males (50% vs. 42%).
In short, Table 3 makes clear that the impacts of COVID-19 on the economic well-being and health of
students have been quite heterogeneous, with lower-income and lower-ability students being more adversely
aﬀected.
5.2
The Role of Economic and Health Shocks on Explaining the COVID-19
Eﬀects
To investigate the role of economic and health shocks in explaining the heterogeneous treatment eﬀects
(in section 4.2), we estimate the following speciﬁcation:
∆i = α0 + α1Demogi + α2FinShocki + α3HealthShocki + ϵi,
(2)
where ∆i is the COVID-19 treatment eﬀect for outcome O on student i. Demogi is a vector including
indicators for gender, lower-income, Honors status, and dummies for cohort year and major. FinShocki and
HealthShocki are vectors containing the shock proxies or their principal component. Finally, ϵi denotes an
idiosyncratic shock.
The parameters of interest are α2 and α3. A causal interpretation of these parameters hinges on the
identiﬁcation assumption that FinShocki and HealthShocki are independent of ϵi.
In our context, we
believe that this assumption is reasonable given that FinShocki and HealthShocki contain variables that
capture arguably exogenous changes due explicitly to the COVID-19 outbreak or were determined before the
pandemic began. For example, it is reasonable to assume that a family member losing a job or a student’s
baseline health status is independent of the idiosyncratic term. On the other hand, if a student losing a
12


## Page 14

job or missing a future debt payment is correlated with idiosyncratic factors that are also likely to aﬀect
the change in the student’s outcomes (such as change in graduation timing), the identiﬁcation assumption
would be invalid. In this case (where the omitted factors are positively correlated with the shock proxies),
the overall ability of the proxies to explain the treatment eﬀect may then be interpreted as an overestimate
of the true role of each type of shock in shaping treatment eﬀects. Thus, in the presence of unobservable
variables, we should be cautious in interpreting the coeﬃcients on the proxy variables.
Table 4 shows estimates of equation (2) for four diﬀerent outcomes (Appendix Table A2 shows the esti-
mates for additional outcomes). For each outcome, ﬁve speciﬁcations are reported ranging from controlling
for only demographic variables in the ﬁrst speciﬁcation to controlling for both economic and health factors
in the fourth speciﬁcation. Finally, the last column includes only the principal component of each shock
to provide insight about overall eﬀects, given that certain shock proxies show high levels of correlation (see
appendix Table A4 for the correlations within each set of proxies).
Several important messages emerge from Table 4. First, both shocks are (economically and statistically)
signiﬁcant predictors of the COVID-19 eﬀects on students’ outcomes. In particular, F-tests show that the
ﬁnancial and health shock proxies are jointly signiﬁcant across almost all speciﬁcations.15
This is also
reﬂected in the statistical signiﬁcance of the principal components. Moreover, the fact that the eﬀect of key
proxy variables remains robust when we simultaneously control for both shocks demonstrates the robustness
of our results. For example, we ﬁnd that a 50 percentage point increase in the probability of being late on
debt payments increases the probability of delaying graduation and switching majors due to COVID-19 by
6.9 and 6.4 percentage points, respectively. These eﬀects are large given that they represent more than half
of the overall COVID-19 treatment eﬀect for these variables. Similarly, we ﬁnd that an analogous increase
in the probability of hospitalization if contracting COVID-19 leads to a 6 and 5 percentage points increase
in the probability of delaying graduation and switching majors due to COVID-19.
Second, in terms of labor market expectations, we ﬁnd that the change in the expected probability of
ﬁnding a job before graduation strongly depends on having a family member that lost income (which is also
correlated with the student himself losing a job). In particular, the size of this eﬀect represents 32% of the
overall COVID-19 treatment eﬀect. Therefore, this ﬁnding suggests that students’ labor market expectations
are driven in large part by personal/family experiences.
Third, although the proxies play an important role in mediating the pandemic’s impact on students, there
is still a substantial amount of variation in COVID-19 treatment eﬀects left unexplained. Across the four
outcomes in Table 4, the full set of proxies explain less than a quarter of the variation in outcomes across
individuals. Appendix Figure A2 visualizes this variation by plotting the distribution of several continuous
15The only exception is the ﬁnancial shock when explaining changes in the probability of taking classes online.
13


## Page 15

outcomes with and without controls. While the interquartile range noticeably shrinks after conditioning on
the proxy variables, these plots highlight the large amount of variation in treatment eﬀects remaining after
conditioning on the proxies.
Finally, our results show that the ﬁnancial and health shocks play an important role in explaining the
heterogeneous eﬀects of the COVID-19 outbreak.
In particular, columns (4) and (9) demonstrate that
economic and health factors together can explain approximately 40% and 70% of the income gap in COVID-
19’s eﬀect on delayed graduation and changing major respectively. The gap between Honors and non-Honors
students is likewise reduced by 27% and 39% for the same outcomes. Taken together, these results imply
that diﬀerences in the magnitude of COVID-19’s economic and health impact can explain a signiﬁcant
proportion of the demographic gaps in COVID-19’s eﬀect on the decision to delay graduation, the decision
to change major, and preferences for online learning.
These results are important and suggest that by
focusing on mitigating the economic and health burden imposed by COVID-19, policy makers may be able
to signiﬁcantly prevent COVID-19 from exacerbating existing achievement gaps in higher education.

Conclusions
This paper provides the ﬁrst systematic analysis of the eﬀects of COVID-19 on higher education. To
study these eﬀects, we surveyed 1,500 students at Arizona State University, and present quantitative evidence
showing the negative eﬀects of the pandemic on students’ outcomes and expectations. For example, we ﬁnd
that 13% of students have delayed graduation due to COVID-19. Expanding upon these results, we show
that the eﬀects of the pandemic are highly heterogeneous, with lower-income students 55% more likely to
delay graduation compared to their higher-income counterparts. We further show that the negative economic
and health impacts of COVID-19 have been signiﬁcantly more pronounced for less advantaged groups, and
that these are partially responsible for the underlying heterogeneity in the impacts that we document. Our
results suggest that by focusing on addressing the economic and health burden imposed by COVID-19, as
measured by a relatively narrow set of mitigating factors, policy makers may be able to prevent COVID-19
from widening existing achievement gaps in higher education.

Figure A2: Distribution of Individual Eﬀects
Notes: Data winsorized below 5% and above 95%. Controls include cohort ﬁxed eﬀects, major ﬁxed eﬀects,
and the economic/health proxies in Table 3. Conditional distribution adjusted to preserve unconditional
mean. Within each plot: middle line represents median, edges of box represent interquatile range (IQR),
edge of whisker represents the adjacent values or the 25th(75th) percentile plus(minus) 1.5 times the IQR.
Outlier observations past adjacent values plotted as individual points.
