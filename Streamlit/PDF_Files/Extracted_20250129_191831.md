Instructions: 
You are working in a startup that is planning to build an AI application that requires a significant 
amount of data from unstructured sources like pdf files and web pages. To evaluate feasibility 
and understand tool compatibility and capability, you have been tasked to evaluate multiple 
products and build out a prototype application that can be used to test out the capabilities. Your 
team is given the following requirements:  
-​
You need to try open source tools and an out of the box enterprise service and compare 
and contrast features.​
For the downstream process, you need to organize the files you scraped into a standard 
format for which you will use docking/markitdown. Review pros and cons of using both 
-​
You need to organize the files with links to images for retrieval later in an S3 bucket. 
Research and come up with a methodology to organize your files.

1.​ Data Extraction: 
○​ PDF Files: 
■​ Develop two Python functions to parse selected PDF files containing 
images, charts, and tables. 
■​ Utilize open-source tools such as PyPDF2 and pdfplumber for text and 
element extraction. 
■​ Implement an enterprise service like Microsoft Document Intelligence to 
process PDFs and convert them to Markdown format. 
○​ Webpages: 
■​ Develop two Python functions to scrape chosen webpages containing 
images, charts, and tables. 
■​ Use libraries like BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and requests for 
HTTP requests. 
■​ Implement Microsoft Document Intelligence to process webpage content 
and convert it to Markdown format. 
2.​ Comparison of Tools: 
○​ Open-Source vs. Enterprise Solutions: 
■​ Evaluate the performance, accuracy, and ease of use between 
open-source tools (PyPDF2, pdfplumber, BeautifulSoup etc) and 
enterprise services (Microsoft Document Intelligence). 
■​ Document the pros and cons of each approach, considering factors like 
cost, scalability, and integration capabilities. 
3.​ Standardization with Docling and MarkItDown: 
○​ Integration: 
■​ Develop functions to integrate Docling and MarkItDown into your 
processing pipeline. 
■​ Use both tools to convert and standardize the extracted content into 
Markdown format, preserving the structure and formatting. 
■​ Compare and contrast Pros and Cons for both approaches 
Part 2: File Organization and Storage 
1.​ Organizing the output Files in S3: 
○​ Methodology: 
■​ Implement a structured naming convention for S3 buckets and objects to 
facilitate easy retrieval and management. 
■​ Use prefixes (folders) to categorize files by type (e.g., PDFs, images, 
Markdown files) and source (e.g., scraped websites, processed 
documents). 
■​ Assign metadata tags to objects for enhanced searchability and access 
control. 
○​ Best Practices: 
■​ Ensure bucket names are globally unique and reflect their purpose. 
■​ Implement proper data partitioning strategies to optimize performance.

■​ Apply appropriate access controls and encryption to secure data. 
Part 3: API Development and Deployment 
1.​ API Development with FastAPI: 
○​ Create API endpoints to handle PDF and webpage uploads, triggering the 
respective processing functions. 
○​ Develop additional endpoints to interact with Docling and MarkItDown for 
document standardization. 
○​ Implement functionality to store processed files and metadata in S3. 
2.​ Client-Facing Application with Streamlit: 
○​ Develop a Streamlit interface allowing users to upload PDFs or input webpage 
URLs. 
○​ Integrate the interface with FastAPI to process inputs and retrieve results. 
○​ Host the Streamlit application on Streamlit's public cloud platform for accessibility. 
Submission: 
1.​ GitHub Repository: 
○​ Include a Project Summary, PoC, and other relevant information. 
○​ Use GitHub Issues to track tasks and optimize the implementation process. 
○​ Include diagrams, a fully documented Codelab, and a 5-minute video showcasing 
the solution. 
○​ Provide a link to the hosted application and backend services. 
2.​ Documentation: 
○​ Provide comprehensive documentation, including a README.md detailing the 
repository's structure. 
○​ Ensure that users have clear guidance for accessing and using the deployed 
applications. 
3.​ AI Use disclosure: 
○​ Along with the readme.md, there should be a AiUseDisclosure.md detailing what 
AI tools you used and why
